### Event Booking System

This project consists of developing a transactional web application that allows users to book venues and hire additional services for different types of events. The system aims to provide a simple and efficient experience, integrating features such as user registration, reservation management, availability checking through an interactive calendar, and secure payment processing.

The project is developed by applying the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in order to build a modular, scalable, and easy-to-maintain solution.
